•	Received multiple Lockheed Martin awards of recognition for Leadership and Innovation in Data Storage Services across multiple DoD contracts.

•	Implemented new automation and test diagnostics software using a blend of Java and Bash scripting to implement integration and system acceptance tests, and benchmarking tests.

•	Refactored legacy Java software to take advantage of modern software practices and utilities.

•	Implemented a universal data archival utility with plugin capabilities to interface with multiple existing legacy databases as well as modern OpenSource databases.

•	Rearchitected Lockheed Martin CORBA Object naming service LDAP design, using mirroring and reducing wasteful clutter and legacy hacks.  Hardened the LDAP database to exceed DISA standards for security and auditing.

•	Lead small teams of developers through phases of Development, Integration and Test, and Production for the Data Storage Service product of a large Sonar monitoring system for multiple software release cycles.

•	Held position of software and database expert on four large-scale DoD contracts for Sonar systems.

Research and Development (June 2016 - Current)

•	Developer in an on-going Research and Development project aimed towards overhauling legacy software architecture using distributed processing, data acquisition, and cluster storage for target delivery to four large-scale DoD contracts.

•	Implemented a high-throughput large video streaming database using a blend of Java+Jetty/Jackson, NodeJS, MongoDB, and HDFS.  Lead successful initiative to strategically migrate legacy systems to new distributed storage solution to increase data rates, reliability, and scalability.

•	Implemented cluster-wide key systems metrics gathering services to monitor and feed back system metrics on over a dozen software applications, stored in MongoDB, and displayed via a web GUI written in NodeJS+ReactJS.

•	Implemented new data processing cluster using Spark/Hadoop/HDFS, Marathon, Mesos, KVM, Docker, and Open vSwitch, tailor made to optimize performance for large-scale virtualization of Acoustic Intelligence software platforms.  Designed improvements over previous model to increase the cluster’s durability, interoperability, and scalability as new hardware is added.
Foreign Contracts (February 2013 - March 2014, April 2015 - Current)

•	Performed as System Engineer and Project Lead for single-stack United Kingdom Sonar System contract, leading a team of a 10 developers to design, implement, and deliver Sonar software and hardware.  Successfully delivered product on cost and schedule in 2014.

•	Supported Japan customer Data Storage Systems troubleshooting questions involving lengthy over-the-wire diagnostics.

•	Innovated new storage services for Japan customer using Docker, MongoDB, NodeJS, and a C++11 client API.  The storage services exceeded the customer’s data requirements and scalability.

•	Provided legacy software systems support for Canadian Sonar equipment contract through 2015 and 2016.  Improved Data Storage Systems software solution in reliability and scalability.
Services and Infrastructure (June 2016 - Current)

•	Innovated new DevOps environment for a common Development and Production platform for three large-scale DoD contracts using GitLab, Jenkins, Artifactory, Gradle, and Docker.  Gathered support and feedback from project managers to assemble a team and acquire funding to revitalize the DevOps environment to satisfy custom requirements across all contracts.

•	Lead large team of project managers and Services developers to create a small-scale oVirt infrastructure with a NetApp distributed network storage backend to support a growing DevOps environment.  Worked with product procurement to purchase the optimal compute node hardware solution for the new environment, and worked with Services teams to design, build, and harden the system through Lockheed Martin Information Assurance to meet and exceed DISA standards.

•	Performed as SCRUM Master leading an Agile team of four developers and twenty Stakeholders to gather feedback and direction as development of the modern software build environment progressed.  Worked through challenges of balancing Stakeholder feedback against meeting requirements on cost and schedule to develop a flexible and scalable DevOps build structure.

•	Attended Atlassian JIRA conference in San Francisco, CA in November 2015 and distributed knowledge and resources to help improve site-wide use of Atlassian toolsets for shared DevOps workspaces.

•	Took numerous Gradle courses on build topics and applied that knowledge to integrate critical capabilities into our existing build structure, improving the reliability and repeatability of our software builds.  Improved the speed of the software builds and decreased the amount of manual maintenance on builds across multiple large software projects.


Personal Projects

•	Developed a tiny-scale oVirt Virtualization network at home for use in creating Linux KVM machines for various home-project uses.  This was in part to explore the capabilities of oVirt and RHEV services, but also to make any number of Linux services available without spending money on additional hardware.

•	Developed a MariaDB based note taking database, so I can record and collate data on various topics using table join operations (useful for handling income and expenses, maintaining databases of movies my family has watched, and so on)

•	Briefly experimented with OpenCV framework and Kinect to generate 3D models from live-stream video data.  Tinkered with optimizing the performance of video streams through caching and optimization of handling image matrix byte buffers.
