### Experience {#experience}

Lockheed Martin

: *Data Storage Developer* __2009 - Current__
  Maintained a custom Java-based Data Storage Service handling Terabytes of streaming sensor data across a distributed network.  Implemented design improvements in multiple iterations of software deliveries within 80% of allocated budgets, and improving read performance by 200% and write performance by 50%.

: *Modern Storage Solutions* __2016 - Current__
  Implemented a new, low-latency video streaming database using Java+Jetty, MongoDB, and HDFS offering a 300% improvement over the Java-based storage service in throughput and reduction of latency in per-frame write operations.  The service was also designed to operate within a Docker container for improved portability, and improved scalability by running in a distributed architecture across the system.

: *Data Storage Lead* __2014 - Current__
  Lead team of five developers to deliver enhancements and bugfixes to storage solution, meeting cost and schedule on multiple deliveries under various contracts.

: *Services Lead* __2016 - Current__
  Innovated new DevOps environment for a common Development and Production platform for three large-scale DoD contracts using GitLab, Jenkins, Artifactory, Gradle, and Docker.  Lead team of four developers through SCRUM Agile development to create a new environment that functions to scale, and yielded an 85% reduction in build time.

: *Infrastructure Developer* __2016 - Current__
  Lead team of Services, Infrastructure, and IT engineers through procurement of cluster hardware to design a RHEL oVirt cluster to improve our DevOps environment.  The approved design will reduce the hardware costs by 50-75% for delivering new products, and increase the High Availability and Data Recovery strategies by immeasurable amounts.

: *Research and Development Engineer* __2016 - Current__
  Implemented new data processing cluster using Spark/Hadoop/HDFS, Marathon, Mesos, KVM, Docker, and Open vSwitch, tailor made to optimize performance for large-scale virtualization of Acoustic Intelligence software platforms.  Designed improvements over previous model to increase the cluster durability, interoperability, and scalability as new hardware is added.
